# Rayua

[Raylib](https://raylib.com) bindings for [Uiua](https://uiua.org)

This is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.

Filling out these bindings will be used to test Uiua's [`&ffi`](https://uiua.org/docs/&ffi) function for correctness.

# How to use

To run the example, you must first set the `RAYLIB_PATH` environment variable to the path of the raylib library.

Then, simply run
```
uiua run example.ua
```
